##  Why you should you go for a job in IT ?

Technology is an industry that is growing so fast and expected to grow another 38% by 2020. 
Almost all the technology companies value the culture. Not only is it free to wear casual 
clothes to work, but you will also find most places have flexible working hours. Many companies
 offer free lunch, free internetâ€”also, on-site coffee machines, which are the primary needs when
  you turn coffee into code :-) .


In my experience, tech companies take good care of our workplace and the working environment, 
because that plays a primary role when it comes to the efficiency of employees.

Since technology is an area that is updating and upgrading continuously, working in a tech company, even for a short period, can be a magnificent learning opportunity.
Also, most of the people that are working IT industry have common interests, and most of the time, they are from close age groups. Because of that, you will find yourself feeling happy and comfortable when working in a tech company.


## What are the things you should do?


### <u>Create a public profile and promote yourself</u>

</div>

There are lots of platforms available for you to create an online presence and showcase your skills.
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/), and [Medium](https://www.medium.com/) 
are the leading platforms when it comes to professional online profiles.  Maintaining these profiles is an 
excellent way to show others that you are interested in technology, and you are up to date with the industry.
  

You do not need to have thousands of followers or likes. Keeping it up to date and professional is enough. 
That means that you need to share and post things relevant to your professional career. 
Please do not post what you had for lunch. Keep it professional.

If you are new to these platforms, this might seems like hard work. And you might 
feel uncomfortable when sharing your details. In my previous experience, the best way is to
follow someone you know and have a good online profile. Try to copy what they do on these platforms
to understand the platforms better.

### <u>Showoff your skillset</u>

If you are a good programmer, you can create a couple of programs and add them to your [Github](https://www.github.com/) profile. Use different programming languages and frameworks when developing those programs to show that you are dynamic, and you are a fast learner. 

If you are a frontend designer, prepare a set of frontends for desktop, mobile, and web applications and put them somewhere, which you can quickly show someone the designs.

 If you are more interested in system architectures and system designs, or you are into the business analysis side, try writing blog posts about your concerned areas. You can either use LinkedIn or Medium to write your blog posts. If you are good in all the above areas, try developing your own blog, this will help you to impress others with all of your skills.

### <u>Always try new things and contribute to the society</u>

As an addition to showoff your skills, have a side project which you always build and add new features. Use the latest technologies when making this side project. This will be a great aid to show that you enjoy developing, and you have the skills that you mentioned in your resume for pages. Also, this project can be a great conversation starter when you try to network with someone in the technology business. 

And if you are an exceptional programmer, you can contribute to the Open source community. There are thousands of open-source projects available in GitHub that you can start contributing right away. Even if you are not an 

If you are not a great programmer, you can contribute by solving problems and doing research on issues. Create an account in [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com), search for areas of your expertise, answer to the questions that have been asked in the platform.


### <u>Improve your network within the industry</u>

In the industry of technology, networking is the number one priority. Meet people, participate in events. This is a great way to know what are the trending technologies at the moment, what others are working on currently. 
When you participate in tech talk, go, and talk with the speaker at the end of the event. Because usually, the person giving the speech has some experience in the industry. By talking to them, you will be able to learn from them from their experience.

Don't just go to events with the sole purpose of finding a job. Do enjoy, learn new things. When next time you are at an interview, maybe one of the persons in the interview panel can be a person that you built a network recently. It will give you confidence and an advantage when facing the interview.
