HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been the base languages for nearly two decades and still holds true today. However, how these languages are implemented has changed significantly.

  

### JavaScript Frameworks Vs Libraries

A library is a set of pre-written code that acts as a toolkit for developers. While being useful, do not impose any structure on the developer's code. Ex: JQuery 

JavaScript frameworks are tools created to speed up the development and standardize the code in order to build modern apps with a more manageable code base.

  

### Importance of JavaScript Frameworks

As of for now almost all have internet in their handheld devices, rather than spending money to develop complex stand-alone software, companies are trying to develop more simple web applications where users can interact with the systems yet feel like working on a stand-alone system.

Most of the times, every web application have similar functions. Therefore developers can reuse functions that they already wrote. It is so much easier and manageable when using a JavaScript framework.

  

Frameworks have their own unique features. And developers can utilize more than one framework to get benefits from different frameworks.
